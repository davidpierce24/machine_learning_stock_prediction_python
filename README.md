# Potential - a Python Machine Learning Stock Predictor

I made this project recently after I learned Python so I could grow my skills in data science and hopefully learn more about machine learning. This app allows the user to type in a ticker symbol for any stock and see the recent pricing chart as well as a chart forecasting prices in the near future. This forecast is using the Prophet machine learning model from Meta, which builds its forecast from the stock's previous price data. I don't know a tremendous amount about data science in Python and much less about machine learning, but this was a really cool project to start exploring and learn about some of the Python data science basics. I'm definitely hoping to dive in more in the future.
